    <p>Remove Google from your life? Yes, it can be done!</p>
    <p>Google trackers have been found on <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/followed-by-ads/">75%
        of the top million websites</a>. This means they are not only tracking
      what you search for, they're also tracking which websites you visit, and
      using all your data for ads that follow you around the Internet. Your
      personal data can also be subpoenaed by lawyers, including for civil
      cases like divorce. Google answered <a
        href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?metric=users_accounts">over
        150,000 such data requests</a> in 2019 alone!</p>
    <p>More and more people are also realizing the risk of relying on one
      company for so many personal services. If you're joining the ranks of
      people who've decided Google's data collection has become too invasive,
      here are some suggestions for replacements with minimal switching cost.
      Most are free, though even those that are paid are worth it — the cost
      of not switching is a cost to your personal privacy, and the good news
      is we have a choice!</p>
    <h2 id="search">Google Search → <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>
      (free) , <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave</a> (free)</h2>
    <p>Switching to DuckDuckGo not only keeps your searches private but also
      gives you extra advantages such as bang shortcuts, handy Instant
      Answers, and knowing you're not trapped in a filter bubble. </p>
    <p>Brave is a new (still in Beta) search engine with a nice looking
      interface and very satisfying search results. I recommend you to try
      that.</p>
    <h2 id="gmail">Gmail, Calendar &amp; Contacts → <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">FastMail</a>
      (paid), <a href="https://protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a> (free with paid
      options), <a href="https://www.tutanota.com">Tutanota</a> (free with
      paid options)</h2>
    <p>FastMail is an independent, paid service that also includes calendar
      and contacts support across all devices.</p>
    <p>ProtonMail is an end-to-end encrypted email service and its free for
      personal use.</p>
    <h2 id="youtube">YouTube →&nbsp; <a href="https://yewtu.be/feed/popular">Invidious</a>
      (Ungoogled Youtube), <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> (free with
      paid options)</h2>
    <p>I recommend you to try invidious</p>
    <h2 id="maps">Google Maps → <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple
        Maps</a> (free), <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>
      (free)</h2>
    <p>For iOS users, Apple gives you an alternative built in via Apple Maps,
      so no installation is necessary. For wider device support, check out
      OpenStreetMap (OSM) which is more open, though may not have the same
      ease-of-use or coverage quality as Apple Maps.</p>
    <h2 id="drive">Google Drive → <a href="https://www.resilio.com/individuals/">Resilio
        Sync</a> (free with paid options), <a href="https://tresorit.com/">Tresorit</a>
      (paid), <a href="https://mega.io/">Mega</a> (free with paid options) ,
      <a href="https://www.pcloud.com/">pCloud</a> (free with paid options)
    </h2>
    <p>Resilio Sync provides peer-to-peer file synchronization which can be
      used for private file storage, backup, and file sharing. This also means
      your files are never stored on a single server in the cloud! The
      software is available for a wide variety of platforms and devices,
      including servers. </p>
    <p>An alternative cloud storage and backup service with end-to-end
      encryption is Mega.</p>
    <h2 id="chrome">Google Chrome → <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>
      (free), <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> (free), <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a>
      (free)</h2>
    <p>A more cross-device compatible browser is Mozilla's Firefox, an open
      source browser with a built-in tracker blocker. </p>
    <p>Brave goes one step further with tracker blocking switched on by
      default. </p>
    <h2 id="messaging">Google Duo and Android Messages → <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>
      (free), <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> (free)</h2>
    <p>There are several services offering private messaging but, as we've
      mentioned before, Signal gets our recommendation. It offers free,
      end-to-end encryption for both messages and private calls.</p>
    <p>As you can see, moving away from Google needn't be hard. In fact, you
      might find you prefer the alternatives while also getting better
      privacy!</p>
