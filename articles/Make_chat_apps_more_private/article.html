      <h2>What is encryption?</h2>
      <p>Encryption is a process that scrambles your data into a mathematical
        puzzle and make them impossible to understand during transaction. So
        hackers cant read or identify your messages while sending.</p>

    </a></h2>
      <p>Signal is the gold standard for private messaging apps at the moment.
        It is free and open source. Using end-to-end encryption as the default,
        Signal keeps all forms of communication on the platform just about as
        safe as they can be. These features include one-on-one chat, voice, and
        video calls, as well as group chats in all of those forms.</p>
      <h2 id="gmail">Viber <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/4489">

    </a></h2>
      <p>Viber is another great private messaging app. It offers end-to-end
        encryption as the default for its one-on-one and group chats, including
        text, voice, and video. Do note though, that <strong>communities and
          channels on Viber are not end-to-end encrypted</strong>, but you
        should avoid sharing personal information in those places either way.<br>
        <br>
        On the less positive side, when you join a Viber group, <strong>your
          phone number will be visible to everybody.</strong> Also, Viber is
        known to be used by spammers to blast messages and potential viruses.<br>
        <br>
        By default <strong>they also collect personalized data which they use
          to sell ads </strong>and monetize that way, but they have a range of
        options you can turn off to prevent this. Visit the “Personal Data”
        section of the app’s privacy options and review how your data is used.
        Also, you may request and/or delete your data from Viber’s servers.</p>

    </a></h2>
      <p>The ever popular WhatsApp messenger is not known to be the most secure
        platform (part of Facebook), so it has lost a lot of favor with more
        security-conscious users, most of which have moved to other apps like
        Signal, Telegram or paid app Threema. All of that aside, it does still
        offer end-to-end encryption as the default for all of its private chat
        applications. These include messages and calls, both the group and
        one-on-one versions, as well as any photos or files you send on the app.</p>
      <p>What is not private anymore are <strong>communications with businesses</strong>
        that are also on Facebook. These communications will share data with
        both Facebook and the business you’re in communication with.</p>
      <h2 id="maps">Facebook Messenger <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/182">
        <img src="https://shields.tosdr.org/en_182.svg"/>
    </a></h2>
      <p>Facebook Messenger has a shady past in regards to user privacy. From
        admitting that they <strong>scan user messages and files</strong>, to
        forcing the app’s installation with the Facebook app, seemingly to slip
        more permissions by the user. <strong>So avoid using this app.</strong></p>
      <h2 id="drive">Telegram <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/1946">
        <img src="https://shields.tosdr.org/en_1946.svg"/>
    </a></h2>
      <p>Video and voice calls are encrypted by default on Telegram end-to-end,
        however texts and file sharing are not. Telegram’s default messaging
        mode is only encrypted between the sender and Telegram servers </p>
      <p>you can initiate a<strong> “Secret Chat.”</strong> What this means is
        that the messages in that chat are end-to-end encrypted, and the sender
        has complete control over whether or not the receiver can keep those
        messages that they exchange. You can set parameters over how long the
        message exists after it’s been read, or even delete it from both chat
        participants' apps at once. These secret chats are not stored to
        Telegram’s cloud either, so the messages are as secure as can be, so
        long as your device isn’t compromised.</p>
      <h2 id="chrome">Discord <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/536">
        <img src="https://shields.tosdr.org/en_536.svg"/>
    </a></h2>
      <p>The platform <strong>does not offer end-to-end encryption</strong> for
        text or audio/video communication. While your data is encrypted in
        transit to Discord servers, it is stored on said servers. Even when you
        use the app’s privacy settings to disable their ability to “Use data to
        improve Discord,” they still collect this data and store it in their
        database. </p>
      <p>If you find yourself using this app, be careful about any sensitive
        personal information you transmit. </p>

      <p>Zoom added the ability to <strong>enable end-to-end encryption for
          your meetings</strong>, and you can even set it as the default type of
        encryption for your Zoom organization (they still call it a "technical
        preview"). You can verify this setting is on by checking for an icon of
        a padlock inside of a green shield in the top-left corner of your
        meeting.</p>
