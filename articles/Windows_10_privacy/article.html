        <p><strong>1. Use a password rather than a PIN for local accounts.</strong><br>
            Whether you use a local account or Microsoft account, make sure you use a strong, alphanumeric password.</p>

        <p><strong>2. You don’t have to link your PC with a Microsoft account <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/244">

        </a>.</strong><br>
            You can create a local account instead. This avoids sharing data about your account, although you lose the
            ability to share data across devices.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in with a local account instead</em>
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Randomize your hardware address on Wi-Fi.</strong><br>
            Enabling random hardware addresses makes you less prone to tracking across different Wi-Fi networks. Note
            that not all devices support this.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Wi-Fi</em>
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. Don’t automatically connect to open Wi-Fi networks.</strong><br>
            Windows 10 can connect to suggested open Wi-Fi hotspots automatically. Disable this setting to give you more
            control over your network connections.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Wi-Fi</em>
        </p>

                alt="Screenshot showing disabling automatic wifi hotspot connection on Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>5. Disable Cortana to keep voice data private.</strong><br>
            Using Cortana, the voice-controlled assistant, sends commands back to Microsoft as well as data about your
            files for local search. Disabling Cortana is more private but you lose voice-control functionality.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Cortana</em>
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2017/07/windows10-5.png"
                alt="Screenshot showing disabling of Cortana in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>6. Watch out for system updates changing your privacy settings.</strong><br>
            System updates are enabled by default which could revert your settings or add new ones, granting more access
            to parts of your system. Go back and check your settings after each major update, including looking for new
            items.</p>
        <p>Most privacy settings on Windows 10 are accessible in the Privacy area of Settings. We recommend looking
            through each section in detail, though here are the main settings to look out for:</p>
        <p><strong>7. Don’t share your advertising ID with apps on your system.</strong><br>
            Disabling this also resets your advertising ID.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; General</em>
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2017/07/windows10-7.png"
                alt="Screenshot showing hiding advertising ID in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>8. Control which apps and services have access to your location.</strong><br>
            You could also disable this entirely if not needed.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location</em>
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2017/07/windows10-8.png"
                alt="Screenshot showing location services in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>9. Control which apps can access sensitive data.</strong><br>
            You can block access to features such as camera, microphone, contacts, calendar and call history.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera/Microphone/Contacts/Calendar/Call history</em>
        </p>

                alt="Screenshot showing camera access in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>10. Stop your speaking and typing being sent to the cloud.</strong><br>
            Note that this needs to be enabled to be able to speak to Cortana.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Speech, Inking, &amp; Typing</em>
        </p>

                alt="Screenshot showing disabling speech services in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>11. Keep your account info private.</strong><br>
            Decide which apps, if any, should have access to your account details such as your name and picture.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Account info</em>
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2017/08/windows10-11.png"
                alt="Screenshot showing disabling account info sharing in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>12. Restrict the apps that can send or receive messages.</strong><br>
            Electronic communications often contain sensitive data, so consider which apps really need access to your
            email, text or MMS messages.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Email/Messaging</em>
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2017/07/windows10-12.png"
                alt="Screenshot showing restricting SMS access in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>13. Decide whether apps can control radios such as Bluetooth.</strong><br>
            Note that turning this off doesn’t disable Bluetooth, it just prevents apps from being able to control
            it.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Radios</em>
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2017/07/windows10-13.png"
                alt="Screenshot showing disabling radios in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>14. Control apps’ ability to sync with non-pairing devices.</strong><br>
            Examples of such devices include beacons that transmit advertising information to devices in close
            proximity, such as in retail outlets.<br>
            <strong>How:</strong> <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Other devices</em>
        </p>

                alt="Screenshot showing disabling automatic sync in Windows 10" loading="lazy"></p>
        <p><strong>15. Limit the feedback and usage data that is sent to Microsoft.</strong><br>
            Note that in “Feedback &amp; diagnostics” only “Basic” is available — there’s no “Disable.” We recommend
            also turning off the tailored tips based on your data.<br>
