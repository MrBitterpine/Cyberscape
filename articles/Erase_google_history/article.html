    <h2>Why Is Google Saving All User Data?</h2>
    <p>Your private information is Google’s golden key to success. And every
      time you use an additional Google product, you provide Google with even
      more data.<br>
      <br>
      So, what does Google do with all that data?<br>
      <br>
      It’s pretty simple. Google uses this data for three purposes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Firstly, Google uses customer data to absolutely own the advertising
        industry.</li>
      <li>Secondly, Google partners up with governments and helps them to
        gather data and conduct mass surveillance.</li>
      <li>Thirdly, Google uses the data to grow newly acquired businesses
        under the Google banner. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Google uses cookies to track every user on all of its platforms. And it
      doesn’t stop there. Google also creates a log file every time you browse
      on Google.<br>
      <br>
      A log file typically saves your IP address, what operating system or
      device is being used, what browser you’re using, as well as the date,
      time, and language of your search query (and the query itself, of
      course).
    </p>
    <h2>Download Data You Want to Keep</h2>
    <p>Follow the next steps to save important data: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in to your Google account.</li>
      <li>Visit <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout">Google’s
          data takeout page</a>.</li>
      <li>The next step is to check the items you want to download.</li>
      <li>Once you’ve made a selection of items you want to download, scroll
        down and click “Next.”</li>
      <li>Select the file type of download .tgz or .zip and select "create
        archive"</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Disable Google From Tracking My Activity</h2>
    <p>After completing the process of deleting all your data, it’s important
      to disable all activity tracking.</p>

    <h2> Does Google Really Delete Your Data?</h2>
    <p>You can find and delete your activity in "My Activity," and you can
      stop Google from saving most activity at any time. However, your data
      will still be stored in Google's server backups, at least for a short
      period of time.</p>
    <h2>
      What Happens if I Clear
      All Google Data?</h2>
    <p>
      you clear your Google data, your search results will not be as
      personalized as they were before deleting the data. However, on the
      bright side, Google no longer has any data on your previous online
      travels.</p>
