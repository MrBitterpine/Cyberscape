    <p>Worried about hackers getting access to your email, social media or
      bank accounts? Follow these simple steps to complete online security and
      peace of mind.</p>
    <p>Most of us like to think we're pretty tech-savvy, but research has
      shown that 59% of people use the same password for most websites.</p>
    <p>This means a Facebook hacker could also gain access to your smartphone,
      online file storage, email, Amazon account, smart TV, Google Maps
      history, social networks... basically your life.</p>
    <h2>Staying safe online: The basics</h2>
    <h3>Update regularly</h3>
    <p>Use auto-updates to get the latest patches for apps, software and
      operating systems.</p>
    <h3>Passwords: don’t re-use them</h3>
    <p>Using the same password on a whole raft of logins is a rookie mistake.
      Once hackers get one password, they’ll try it on everything else they
      can connect you to.</p>
    <h3>Download from authorised sources</h3>
    <p>Whether you 'side-load' apps (self-install them) or go for open source
      software, make sure you get them from trusted sites.</p>
    <p>Check for any bundled bits ('spyware' or 'adware') and remove them –
      toolbars and add-ons that change your default search engines are the
      biggest culprits.</p>
    <h3>'Administrator' shouldn't be&nbsp;your default setting</h3>
    <p>Don’t log in as admin on your computer for day-to-day use (except when
      you have to, like if you're installing stuff). If you download something
      dodgy or have already been compromised, hackers can track, install and
      change pretty much whatever they like.</p>
    <h3>Turn off when you’re done</h3>
    <p>That includes logging out of sites when you’ve had your fill of memes,
      switching off the computer when you leave the house, or disconnecting
      the WiFi when you’re not using it.</p>
    <h3>Encrypt to keep your stuff unreadable</h3>
    <p>Encryption doesn’t stop files, emails or details you submit through a
      website being intercepted – it ‘scrambles’ the content so they can’t be
      read by unauthorised users.</p>
    <p>One of the most common forms of encryption you can make use of is to
      check for the little padlock symbol next to the URL (or that the address
      starts with https, not just http) when you're logging in or providing
      payment details. Most sites use this nowadays anyway, but it's always
      worth checking!</p>
    <h2 data-pnp-apb-index="1" class="bg-colour-pink">How to protect your
      computer from hackers and viruses</h2>
    <p>Protecting yourself from getting hacked can take just a couple of
      minutes if you follow these quick steps:</p>
    <h3>Security basics</h3>
    <ul class="numbers2">
      <li>Get yourself decent anti-virus and firewall software – and turn it
        on! Some insurance companies and banks only cover fraud and
        theft&nbsp;if you can prove you&nbsp;had security in place.</li>
      <li>Back-up important data on an external hard drive or USB stick. If
        there’s something that you’d be gutted to lose, keep copies!</li>
      <li>Be picky about which companies you share your personal info with –
        your data’s only as secure as they are.</li>
      <li>Be very suspicious of emails or messages asking for login or account
        info, and check that any links are legit (i.e. not hsbo-bank.co.uk)
        and secure (https not http). This is known as phishing and is one of
        the easiest ways for passwords to be nicked.</li>
      <li>Most cloud storage is snoopable: encrypt the content you keep in
        them or check out Dropbox (which claims to encrypt all files stored).</li>
      <li>Only log in to accounts from your own gadgets. If you do have to use
        a public or shared&nbsp;device, make sure you log out afterwards.</li>
      <li>Where possible, buy online using a credit card. If you're a victim
        of fraud you'll have a better chance of getting your money back. If
        you can't get accepted for a credit card, use a prepaid card instead –
        while this won't insure your stolen cash, hackers will only have
        access to what you've topped up rather than your entire bank balance.</li>
      <li>If there’s something you really, really don’t want anyone else to
        know or get hold of, don’t put it online!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="passwords">How to create a strong password</h3>

        srcset="https://www.savethestudent.org/uploads/easy-password.jpg 713w, https://www.savethestudent.org/uploads/easy-password-400x169.jpg 400w"
        sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" width="713" height="301"></p>
    <ul class="numbers2" start="9">
      <li>Use an unusual but memorable phrase, and replace letters with
        numbers or punctuation marks (0 instead of o, or 3 for E).</li>
      <li>Never use real answers in security questions – make up memorable
        answers that will only make sense to you.</li>
      <li>Change passwords at least a couple of times a year: get fresh ones,
        and don’t just swap around the ones you already use!</li>
      <li>Get <strong>Bitwarden</strong> – seriously. It's all very well (and essential) having
        long and unique passwords for each site, but you'll never remember
        them without a password manager. <strong>Bitwarden</strong> is the most popular free and open source
        solution for storing them all and integrates easily as a browser
        extension (and app).</li>
      <li>Use two-step verification if it’s available for logins: if someone
        signs in from a new or unauthorised device, they’ll have to provide a
        code that’s only sent to your phone or email address.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hide your email from spam bots</h3>
    <ul class="numbers2" start="14">
      <li>Don’t use an easily-guessed email – like yourname@gmail.com – for
        logging into sites holding sensitive information (like online
        banking). Use alias emails that you can simply&nbsp;forward to your
        main account.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>In fact, use alias emails for all aspects of your online life: work,
        personal stuff, online paid surveys, memes, whatever. This will limit
        what info hackers can access (and how much spam you get!).</li>
      <li>Forced to enter an email address but worried you’re going to be
        inundated with spam afterwards? Use one you can burn when you’re done!
        You can create a temporary email that will combust after use over on
        guerrillamail.com.</li>
      <li>If your email account displays the location of the last login (Gmail
        does – check the bottom of the screen), take a look at it every now
        and again to spot any rogue usage.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Check your social media security settings</h3>
    <ul class="numbers2" start="18">
      <li>Check your privacy settings: don’t broadcast every update to the
        whole world. Log out every now and again to view your profile the way
        strangers see it.</li>
      <li>Don’t accept friend requests from folk you don’t know (obviously!)</li>
      <li>Enable login alerts to get beeped when someone signs into your
        account. On Facebook, you can turn it on through Security Settings
        (approve your own devices so you don’t get pointless alerts!).</li>
      <li>Be careful what you share on social, especially your date of birth
        or any info banks use to verify accounts or lost passwords.</li>
      <li>Review app permissions: whenever you log in to another site using
        Facebook or add an app to your account, you've opened another door for
        personal data leakage. See what info you're handing out here.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Protecting your phone and gadgets</h3>
    <ul class="numbers2" start="23">
      <li>Always lock your phone using either fingerprint recognition, a
        secure PIN (not your birthday) or unique gesture.</li>
      <li>Know how to&nbsp;wipe your gadgets if they're lost or stolen.</li>
      <li>Put a sticker over any unused webcams (hackers could be watching
        you).</li>
      <li>Read app permissions to see exactly what data you’re allowing
        them&nbsp;to access before you install them.</li>
      <li>Install Find My iPhone (Apple) or make sure you've set up Find My
        Device on Android. Prey is also excellent for tracking, locking and
        wiping missing phones and laptops.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stay safe when using WiFi</h3>
    <ul class="numbers2" start="28">
      <li>Always password protect your home WiFi network, and change the
        default admin password on your internet routers.</li>
      <li>Remember that public WiFi has more holes than Swiss cheese –
        everything you do while connected can be spied on.</li>
      <li>Only use well-known or reputable WiFi hotspots – setting up fake
        free networks is a common sting.</li>
      <li>Turn off sharing, so that things you usually connect or share on a
        secure network (files, devices or logins) aren’t discoverable.</li>
      <li>Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to 'cloak' yourself and your
        data. Private Internet Access is our favourite due to ease of setup,
        privacy settings and security features.</li>
      <li>Only visit secure sites: check for the padlock and 'https' in the
        address bar.</li>
    </ul>
